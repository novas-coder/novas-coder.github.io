            <p>
                I hadn't done a ton of projects before 2023 because I was still relatively new to programming,
                however, I did try to create some simple programs and applications using Python as well as a website as outlined below:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#virtual-assistant">Virtual Assistant</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#crazy-numbers">Crazy Numbers</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#block-world">Block World</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#website">Personal website for a fictitious client</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3 id="virtual-assistant">Virtual Assistant</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first major project that I did for my
                <a href="https://www.ibo.org/programmes/middle-years-programme/" target="_blank">MYP Personal Project</a>.
                It enabled me to learn much more about Python and think independently.
                I did not use Natural Language Processing (NLP) as that was too complicated for me at the time, however,
                I believe that I can take this project forward and implement a more realistic version of a virtual assistant
                that incorporates NLP and maybe even a simple image recognition feature.
                The features that are currently integrated within this version include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Speech recognition using the
                        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/" target="_blank">SpeechRecognition</a>
                         library (Speech-to-Text)</li>
                    <li>Text-to-Speech using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/" target="_blank">pyttsx3</a>
                         library</li>
                    <li>Jokes, puns, and facts that are randomly selected from a specified list
                        (could use an API now that I have learned about it)</li>
                    <li>Wishing the user based on the time and also telling the time using the
                        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" target="_blank">datetime</a> module</li>
                    <li>Simple answers to basic questions (origin, creator, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Wikipedia searches using the
                        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> library</li>
                    <li>Opening the news
                        (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com" target="_blank">The Straits Times</a>) and searching the
                        Internet using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html" target="_blank">webbrowser</a>
                        module</li>
                    <li>Self-made simple games including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Magic 8-ball</li>
                            <li>Unpredictable Numbers</li>
                            <li>Lucky 7</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Opening applications (YouTube, Chrome, Atom, Discord) using the
                        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html" target="_blank">webbrowser</a>
                         module and the
                         <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" target="_blank">os</a> module</li>
                    <li>Shutting down and logging off the computer using the
                        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" target="_blank">subprocess</a> module</li>
                    <li>Cheesy easter eggs inspired by Google Assistant!</li>
                </ul>
                I was able to expand my knowledge immensely through this project and also wrote my first decent program
                without following any tutorials - Magic 8-ball. From thereon, there was no stopping me, and I went on to
                program all the games of the virtual assistant without any tutorials. However, for most of the other features,
                I had to research and follow tutorials (like
                <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-ai-personal-assistant-using-python-f57247b4494b" target="_blank">this</a>)
                to first understand the basic concepts. One thing that I tried to focus
                on was accessibility. I tried to make my program as accessible as possible by making sure that the program
                both spoke and printed out text whenever there was an output. Similarly, I added manual user input through
                the keyboard for certain parts of the program instead of voice recognition. I was quite pleased with the outcome
                and will never forget this journey.

            <h3 id="crazy-numbers">Crazy numbers</h3>
            <p>
                I created this game whilst I was creating the virtual assistant.
                I intended to create something entertaining but also educative and helpful in some sense.
                The first thing that came to my mind was making a game with the genre of mathematical thinking.
                The gist of the game is that there are 5 possible options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Addition</li>
                    <li>Subtraction</li>
                    <li>Multiplication</li>
                    <li>Division</li>
                    <li>Indices</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of these options has 7 varying levels of difficulty, with the number of points received
                increasing with each level. Some features of this game include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Random number generation using the
                        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank">random</a> module</li>
                    <li>Saving the high score in a <code>.txt</code> file</li>
                    <li>Calculating the time taken for each question to be answered using the
                        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" target="_blank">time</a> module</li>
                    <li>Use of certain visual and textual effects to make the game more engaging</li>
                    <li><u>BONUS</u>: added average time is taken per question and the total number of questions attempted
                        after gaining more experience in programming</li>
                </ul>
                My takeaway from this project was the power of abstraction using functions.
                Initially, as I started developing the game, I realized that a lot of the statements were being repeated
                 - it felt like I was writing spaghetti code. However, I soon came to realize this and implemented functions
                 within my program. It still isn't perfect but it <em>is</em> much better.
            </p>

            <h3 id="block-world">Block World</h3>
            <p>
                I undertook this project because I just wanted to build something fun.
                (or perhaps something that would interest my friends and make me look cool 😎)
                So, I started following incredible
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4l-qozib8&list=PLmP1LNMzp97pQe1FiGpdOLKeWYfTMZM7n" target="_blank">tutorials</a>
                 by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmth-THBKWxLMw3aPsp-jQg" target="_blank">RedHenDev</a>.
                 However, I was just coding along with him,
                and not understanding the tiny specific details of every line of code. I did get the gist of the ideas that he implemented,
                however, I was slightly disheartened as I wasn't able to completely understand everything. Nevertheless,
                it was quite fun and satisfying to see the program work. Some particular features of this Minecraft ripoff included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Perlin noise for terrain generation using the
                        <a href="https://pypi.org/project/perlin-noise/" target="_blank">perlin-noise</a> library</li>
                    <li>Improved gravity system to make the game efficient</li>
                    <li>Effective terrain generation with a unique swirling technique (infinite)</li>
                    <li>The capability of building with different materials and mining only built materials</li>
                    <li>Self-made mods</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Some images of the final product are shown below:

            </p>
            <p>
                However, I recently decided to start again and work on a second version, again following the
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmth-THBKWxLMw3aPsp-jQg" target="_blank">RedHenDev</a> with his new
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fofR4yzTCdA&list=PLmP1LNMzp97rIbwnGHhjjobHHqWekxy8Y" target="_blank">tutorials series</a>.
                With the previous version abandoned, I decided on focusing on adding features that I wasn't able to in the previous version.
                So far, many of them are similar, but a few unique ones include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mining into the terrain (infinitely)</li>
                    <li>Similar terrain generation techniques however with some minor improvements to enhance gameplay</li>
                    <li>Step sounds that change as the terrain changes (from normal terrain to snow in higher terrains)</li>
                    <li>Falling snowflakes that follow the player around</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                An important feature of the second version and my key takeaway was the use of multiple modules
                that all ultimately mingled and worked together to make the game work! It opened my mind up to this way of programming.
                I quickly realized the benefits of stepwise refinement and maintaining organized files.

            <h3 id="website">Personal website for a fictitious client</h3>
            <p>
                I had to make this website (<a href="https://www.ofs.edu.sg/user/s_bhandari/index.html" target="_blank">click here</a>)
                as part of my school assignment in ICT. I devoted a lot of time and effort to making it as appealing as possible for the end user.
                I took many features into careful consideration as well. However, I did not implement a responsive design (unlike this website)
                as I had a lack of knowledge in the field. The website icorporates 6 total pages, 2 of which haven't been completed and
                instead have a countdown. Some features of this website include the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Light/dark mode</li>
                    <li>Header and animated footer</li>
                    <li>Internal and external links</li>
                    <li>An embedded video</li>
                    <li>A login page (currently does not support signing up)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I uploaded the website to the school server, however for some reason the login page doesn't work and some characters
                don't appear the way they're supposed, despite working perfectly fine when I run the website locally. I've come quite
                far since then and have learned a lot of aspects of web development.
