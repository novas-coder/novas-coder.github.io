## Description

My Personal Website as part of CS50x Week 8 Homepage

This website consists of 4 pages: an index page, a projects page, an about page, and a countdown page.

The index page is a means of introduction to my website, with four elements that essentially define me.

The projects page consists of 3 major projects that I had undertaken prior to the start of 2023 since I was still in the process of completing CS50x. Check out my final project for CS50x [here](https://github.com/novas-coder/TaskTastic).

The about page gives an overview of my hobbies and academics, and the countdown page is just a simple countdown to the day I graduate from high school!
