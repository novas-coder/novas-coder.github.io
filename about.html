                                I am not a fitness freak, however, I do maintain my physical health by
                                participating in various clubs and other activities within my school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was part of the high-school cross-country team for season 1.
                                I am part of the track team for season 2 and intend to be part of the cross country or track team throughout high school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, I play in the table tennis club at school and am arguably one of the best in our club.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apart from these sports, I have some experience playing basketball and winning a few tournaments.

                                I have been playing drums since 2015, and also thoroughly enjoy doing so.
                                I have learned to play various songs of different genres over the years and have become quite good at sight-reading.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have recorded my video for grade 6 due to corona, and am expecting to pass and hoping for a distinction :-)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The genre that I usually enjoy playing is rock & pop.
                                However, I have also tried other genres, including mambo, funk, pop-reggae, and much more!

                                I've always been interested in coding since I was little. All those movies with hackers were quite fascinating for me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I started my journey in programming in 2021 when I bought a course for Python on Udemy.
                                And since then, I've begun to expand my skill set by exploring other languages and new concepts until I stumbled upon CS50.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I found CS50 to be a remarkable course, even though at times I found it quite challenging to comprehend and solve the problems.
                                However, in the end, I persevered and am at the second last week!

            <h3>Academics</h3>
            <p>
                I have always been serious about academics and am a straight-A student (literally, as I got 7 A*s for all my IGCSE subjects in total).
                However, I've realized that IB is quite challenging and requires a lot of determination and hard work to get good scores.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to balance out my academics with my extracurriculars, even though this initially took a small toll on my grades :( <br>
                Nevertheless, I've now managed to get a hang of this new <i>lifestyle</i> and I know that in the end, I will do the best I can and be satisfied with the final results.
